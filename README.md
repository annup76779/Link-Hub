# Link-Hub
This is the web app developed in flask python for saving the links with there topic and title : best for students
It sometime happens with students who learn online that they have a greate amount of links with them left so if the decide to put those links/URL at bookmarks it become for them very difficult to find them again if they have that much large number of links/URLs.
So I have developed a web app that stores those link according to the topics specified and show them all when you open the opic from the sidebar.
I have used the back theme when I was desinging.
